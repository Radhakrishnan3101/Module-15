Experiment 9(d) : Heap Tree

Aim

To write a Python program to build a heap tree using appropriate Python package and function.

Algorithm
```
Start the program.
Import the heapq module.
Define a function heaptree() that takes a list H as input.
Use heapq.heapify(H) to convert the list into a valid heap (min-heap).
Print the created heap.
End the program.
Program
import heapq
def heaptree(H):
    heapq.heapify(H)
    print("The created Heap is",H)
```
